# CS 1501 – Algorithm Implementation – Assignment #3 Writeup

The goal of this assignment was to expand on Lab 7 which utilized LZW compression and expansion. I expanded Lab 7 by allowing the codebook size to increase beyond `4096` entries and allowing the option to reset the codebook if it is completely filled.

## LZW.java Modifications

To make our LZW more diversified I needed to allow more user input options. To expand upon the choice to compress I also gave the option to reset to cookbook when filled or not. If the second argument in the input is a `'n'` the cookbook should not reset and a `'r'`. According to this response the first bit written into `BinaryStdOut` will be a 0 for no reset and a 1 for reset. This will allow the decompression program to know if the cookbook is resetting or not.

## DLBCodeBook.java Modifications

In the `add()`method I allowed the codeword width to increment when the codebook is full and it doubles the codebook size.	If W is the max size (`maxW`) it can be and reset is on, it will reset the codebook by calling `initialize()` hence giving more room.

## ArrayCodeBook.java

In the `add()`method I allowed the codeword width to increment when the codebook is full and it doubles the codebook size.	If W is the max size (`maxW`) it can be and reset is on, it will reset the codebook by calling `initialize()` hence giving more room.

I also changed the `getCodewordWidth()` to be more adaptable to the changing width size. During decompression W is a step behind, so W becomes W+1. When the codebook is reset it resets W to `minW`.
